2048-Bot
=============

This is a bot for [the game 2048](http://gabrielecirulli.github.io/2048/). It's quite fast and can reach the 4096 tile consistently. [Here is a gameplay video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HGKy921YY). 

The bot is deployed by pasting its code into the developer console with the game open. It interfaces with the game by looking at the DOM and dispatching key presses. It chooses moves using a shallow depth-first search and simple evaluator.
